I-Nex is an application that gathers information for hardware components available on your system and displays it using an user interface similar to the popular Windows tool CPU-Z.

I-Nex can display information for the following components: CPU, GPU, Motherboard, Sound, Hard disks, RAM, Network and USB as well as some system info like the hostname, Linux distribution and version, Xorg, GCC, GLX versions and Linux Kernel info.


The difference between I-Nex and the other hardware information GUI tools available for Linux is that the information is better organized and is displayed faster (than lshw-gtk for instance). Also, the hardware information is presented in a way thatâ€™s easier to understand than other such tools.

Besides being able to display hardware information, I-Nex can also generate an advanced report for which you can select what to include and optionally send the report to a service such as Pastebin (and others). It also features an option to take a screenshot of the I-Nex window directly from the application.
