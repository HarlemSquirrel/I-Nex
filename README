USING PASTEBIN.D FILES

To enable support for private pastebins, first you will need to know the
fields that are in use by the pastebin when posting data.

Add a file in the /etc/pastebin.d directory with the following format:

[psatebin]
basename = (the domain name of the pastebin site, without subdomains)
regexp = (a regular expression that identifies the base site, and any
		subdomains that may be used)

[format]
pastebinit_field0 = site_field0
pastebinit_fieldN = site_fieldN
custom_field0 = site_fieldN
custom_fieldN = site_fieldN

[defaults]
custom_field0 = value
custom_fieldN = value


THE PASTEBIN SECTION

Under "[pastebin]", you will want to keep the very basic information to
identify the pastebin. Only two fields are used in that section:

	basename - 	the generic domain name for the pastebin.
			this domain name should not contain
			possible subdomains in use.

	regexp -	a regular expression that matches the
			basename, as well as any subdomains that
			may be in use.


THE FORMAT SECTION

Under "[format]", identify the various fields in use in the pastebin you
are trying to add support for. Identify any fields used to publish data
on the pastebin, and add them to the configuration file.

The [format] section expects keywords from the pastebinit utility, for
which the values will be the actual name of the field in which to put the
data for that pastebin.

A number of reserved keywords can be used, but are optional:

	user - 		contains the username for the user
			calling the pastebinit utility.

	content -	contains the data that will be posted.

	title -		contains the title if set at the command
			line.

	version -	contains the version as set at the
			command line.

	format -	contains the format setting:
			usually used for syntax highlighting.

	parentpid -	contains the parent post ID for 
			pastebins that use it.

	permatag -	contains permatag as set at the command
			line.

	username -	contains the pastebin username if 
			required.

	password -	contains the pastebin user's password
			if required.

	jabberid -	contains the jabberid for the poster
			as set at the command line.

Two additional special parameters are available for use:

	page -		used to specify a page from which to
			post data. It is the actual URL of
			the pastebin's form.

	regexp -	used to specify a regexp to execute
			on the resulting page after posting.
			This is useful to deal with special
			pastebins that don't redirect you
			to the new post's URL.

Any other fields in use for the specific pastebin you are trying to enable
may be added to the section using a similar syntax. An easy way to deal with
such a requirement is to repeat the same keyword, such as:

[format]
expire = expire

Where 'page' can then be reused as the keyword to retrieve a static value,
as set in the '[defaults]' section.


THE DEFAULTS SECTION

The '[defaults]' section is used to set static values for custom fields to
retrieve. Some pastebins require setting fields such as expiry time for
posts, or whether to use cookies. Such values would be set using a custom
field if they are deemed necessary. In the above example, to statically
set a page to be used in the 'page' field:

[defaults]
expire = 3600
